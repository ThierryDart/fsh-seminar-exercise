### Local environment

As part of this course, you will edit and build a FHIR Implementation Guide on your computer. To do this, you will need the following:

1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [FSH language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MITRE-Health.vscode-language-fsh)
2.  Install a Java runtime
3.  Install Ruby and Jekyll using [these OS-specific instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides)
4.  Install SUSHI using [these directions](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/installation/)
5.  Download the syllabus IG from `https://github.com/FSHSchool/courses-fsh-seminar-exercise/archive/refs/heads/main.zip` and unzip it, or `git clone https://github.com/FSHSchool/courses-fsh-seminar-exercise.git`
6.  Open a Terminal/Command Prompt window inside the IG folder, and run `./_updatePublisher.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `_updatePublisher.bat` (Windows) from the command line.
    * This will automatically download the latest `publisher.jar` release from [https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases) and put it in the `input-cache/` folder inside the IG folder.
    * The IG folder will be `courses-fsh-seminar-exercise-main/input-cache/` if you used the `.zip` download, or `courses-fsh-seminar-exercise/input-cache/` if you used `git clone`.
7.  Run `./_genonce.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `_genonce.bat` (Windows)
8.  Open `output/index.html` from inside your IG folder. You should see a mostly-empty IG home page that says “FSHSeminarExercise” on it.
